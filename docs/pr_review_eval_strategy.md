# PR Review Tool Evaluation Strategy with Inspect AI

## Overview
This strategy evaluates your PR review tool's effectiveness across multiple dimensions using Inspect AI's evaluation framework.

## 1. Test Dataset Creation

### A. Synthetic PR Categories
- **Bug Introduction**: PRs that introduce obvious bugs (null pointer, off-by-one errors)
- **Security Issues**: PRs with SQL injection, XSS vulnerabilities, hardcoded secrets
- **Performance Problems**: Inefficient algorithms, memory leaks, N+1 queries
- **Code Quality**: Inconsistent naming, poor structure, missing error handling
- **Best Practices**: Missing tests, inadequate documentation, style violations
- **Clean Code**: Well-written PRs that should receive minimal/positive feedback

### B. Real-world PR Dataset
- Collect historical PRs from open-source projects with known outcomes
- Include PRs that were:
  - Merged without issues
  - Required multiple revision rounds
  - Were rejected due to quality issues
  - Had post-merge bugs discovered

## 2. Evaluation Dimensions

### A. Issue Detection Quality
```python
# Metrics to track:
- Precision: % of flagged issues that are actually problems
- Recall: % of actual issues that were caught
- F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- False Positive Rate: % of clean code flagged incorrectly
```

### B. Comment Quality Assessment
```python
# Evaluate each generated comment on:
- Actionability (1-5): Can developer act on this feedback?
- Accuracy (1-5): Is the technical assessment correct?
- Tone (1-5): Is feedback constructive vs harsh?
- Specificity (1-5): Does it point to exact locations/solutions?
```

### C. Coverage Analysis
```python
# Check if tool identifies issues in different code areas:
- Logic errors
- Security vulnerabilities  
- Performance bottlenecks
- Style/formatting issues
- Documentation gaps
- Test coverage problems
```

## 3. Inspect AI Implementation

### A. Core Evaluation Tasks

```python
from inspect_ai import Task, task, Sample
from inspect_ai.dataset import json_dataset
from inspect_ai.scorer import model_graded_qa, match
from inspect_ai.solver import chain_of_thought, generate

@task
def pr_review_accuracy_eval():
    """Test if tool correctly identifies known issues"""
    return Task(
        dataset=json_dataset("datasets/pr_bugs.jsonl"),
        solver=chain_of_thought() + generate(),
        scorer=model_graded_qa(
            template="Does this review correctly identify the bug? {completion}",
            grade_pattern=r"(Yes|No)"
        )
    )

@task  
def pr_review_completeness_eval():
    """Test if tool catches multiple issues in complex PRs"""
    return Task(
        dataset=json_dataset("datasets/multi_issue_prs.jsonl"),
        solver=generate(),
        scorer=coverage_scorer()  # Custom scorer
    )

@task
def pr_review_false_positive_eval():
    """Test tool on clean, well-written code"""
    return Task(
        dataset=json_dataset("datasets/clean_prs.jsonl"), 
        solver=generate(),
        scorer=false_positive_scorer()  # Custom scorer
    )
```

### B. Model Comparison Framework

```python
@task
def multi_model_pr_review():
    """Compare different LLMs on same PR review tasks"""
    models = [
        "gpt-4",
        "claude-3-sonnet-20240229", 
        "gemini/gemini-1.5-pro"
    ]
    
    results = {}
    for model in models:
        results[model] = evaluate_model(model, test_dataset)
    
    return comparative_analysis(results)
```

## 4. Custom Scoring Functions

### A. Issue Detection Scorer
```python
def issue_detection_scorer():
    """Score based on how well tool identifies known issues"""
    def score(state, target):
        detected_issues = extract_issues(state.output.completion)
        expected_issues = target.expected_issues
        
        tp = len(set(detected_issues) & set(expected_issues))
        fp = len(detected_issues) - tp
        fn = len(expected_issues) - tp
        
        precision = tp / (tp + fp) if (tp + fp) > 0 else 0
        recall = tp / (tp + fn) if (tp + fn) > 0 else 0
        f1 = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall) if (precision + recall) > 0 else 0
        
        return Score(
            value=f1,
            metadata={
                "precision": precision,
                "recall": recall, 
                "true_positives": tp,
                "false_positives": fp,
                "false_negatives": fn
            }
        )
    return score
```

### B. Comment Quality Scorer
```python
def comment_quality_scorer():
    """Use LLM to grade comment quality on multiple dimensions"""
    template = """
    Grade this PR review comment on the following criteria (1-5 scale):
    
    Comment: {completion}
    Code Context: {input}
    
    1. Actionability: Can the developer clearly act on this feedback?
    2. Accuracy: Is the technical assessment correct? 
    3. Tone: Is the feedback constructive and professional?
    4. Specificity: Does it point to exact issues with solutions?
    
    Respond with: Actionability: X, Accuracy: Y, Tone: Z, Specificity: W
    """
    
    return model_graded_qa(template=template, grade_pattern=r"Actionability: (\d), Accuracy: (\d), Tone: (\d), Specificity: (\d)")
```

## 5. Test Data Structure

### A. Sample Data Format
```json
{
  "input": "git diff content...",
  "target": {
    "expected_issues": [
      {
        "type": "bug",
        "line": 15,
        "description": "Potential null pointer dereference",
        "severity": "high"
      }
    ],
    "expected_suggestions": [
      "Add null check before accessing user.name",
      "Consider using Optional<T> pattern"
    ]
  },
  "metadata": {
    "language": "java",
    "complexity": "medium", 
    "pr_type": "bug_fix"
  }
}
```

## 6. Evaluation Workflow

### A. Automated Pipeline
1. **Data Collection**: Gather diverse PR samples with ground truth
2. **Baseline Establishment**: Run initial evaluation across all models
3. **Prompt Engineering**: Iterate on prompts, measure improvements
4. **Model Selection**: Choose best-performing model for each use case  
5. **Regression Testing**: Ensure changes don't break existing performance
6. **Production Monitoring**: Continuous evaluation on real usage

### B. Key Metrics Dashboard
```python
# Track over time:
metrics = {
    "overall_accuracy": f1_score,
    "false_positive_rate": fp_rate,
    "comment_quality_avg": quality_score,
    "coverage_by_category": category_scores,
    "cost_per_review": api_costs,
    "latency_p95": response_times
}
```
